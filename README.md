Codsoft Machine Learning Internship
Project Overview
During my Codsoft Machine Learning Internship, I successfully completed four tasks, each focusing on a different aspect of machine learning. Below is a summary of what I learned and the key concepts that could be included in the README files for these tasks:

1. Spam SMS Detection Using Machine Learning
Text Preprocessing: Learned techniques for cleaning and preprocessing text data, including tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming.
Feature Engineering: Gained experience in creating numerical features from text using TF-IDF and Count Vectorizers.
Model Training and Evaluation: Understood how to train and evaluate classification models such as Random Forest, MultinomialNB, and SVC using accuracy, precision, and confusion matrices.
Visualization: Created insightful visualizations like word clouds to explore data distributions.
Deployment: Learned to save and deploy models using Python libraries like pickle.
2. Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning
Data Cleaning: Mastered techniques for handling missing data and encoding categorical variables using label encoding and one-hot encoding.
Feature Scaling: Learned to standardize numerical features to improve model performance.
Model Comparison: Developed an understanding of comparing models such as Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost based on accuracy and classification reports.
Real-World Insights: Extracted meaningful insights about customer behavior from the dataset.
3. Credit Card Fraud Detection
Imbalanced Dataset Handling: Understood the challenges of imbalanced datasets and strategies to address them, such as evaluation metrics like precision and recall.
Feature Selection: Gained experience in selecting the most relevant features for training.
Model Performance Tuning: Improved skills in optimizing models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest to detect fraudulent transactions.
Visualization: Utilized confusion matrices and ROC curves to evaluate model performance visually.
4. Movie Genre Classification Using Machine Learning
Text Classification: Strengthened skills in working with textual data to classify movie genres based on plot summaries.
Natural Language Processing: Implemented NLP techniques such as tokenization, lemmatization, and n-gram generation.
Model Selection: Trained and compared models like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Linear SVM for text classification.
Evaluation and Results Interpretation: Used metrics like F1-score, precision, and recall to interpret results effectively.
Project Overviews
1. Spam SMS Detection Using Machine Learning
This project focuses on detecting spam messages in SMS datasets using machine learning algorithms. The pipeline involves text preprocessing, feature extraction with TF-IDF, and classification using models such as Random Forest, MultinomialNB, and SVC. The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of 97.58%.

2. Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning
The goal of this project is to predict customer churn based on behavioral and demographic data. The dataset is preprocessed by encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical ones. Models like Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost were compared, with Gradient Boosting achieving the highest accuracy of 78.28%.

3. Credit Card Fraud Detection
This project identifies fraudulent transactions in a large credit card dataset. The workflow includes data cleaning, feature scaling, and model training with algorithms like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Decision Trees. Random Forest delivered the best performance with an accuracy of 99.73% and robust fraud detection metrics.

4. Movie Genre Classification Using Machine Learning
This project aims to classify movies into genres based on their plot summaries using natural language processing and machine learning. The textual data is preprocessed and transformed using TF-IDF. Models like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Linear SVM were trained and evaluated. Performance metrics such as precision and recall were used to identify the best-performing model.
